I had watched CODA a few years back but forgot most of it.

Yesterday, deciding whether to rewatch, I realized I remembered nothing except
the feeling that movie evoked.That was enough to pull me back.

Thinking about it, isn’t that the point of books, movies and art in general. It
should touch us the way a dream does, the details fading while the impact stays.
The feeling should linger within us, long after we are done with it.

Every moment in the film is tender, quietly devastating. The performances ache
with such honesty they feel like confessions. This is a film that knows how to
break your heart and mend it in the same breath. Devastatingly beautiful in its
simplicity.

Highly recommend watching it if you haven’t already!
