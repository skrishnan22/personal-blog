I happened to spend 30 days in my native,Chiramadam, a small village of ~200
families,nestled in the tier-2 town of Nagercoil, Tamil Nadu.

It is also after a long while i got to spend time there, without being anxious
of missing standups or slack huddles due to patchy network. Perks of a
sabbatical i guess.

Some observations that no one asked

- Was surprised i was able to wake up consistenly before 8 am not most days and
  even go for walks, weather permitting. For someone who is used to snoozing the
  alarm even at 11 am, this was a welcome change.

Maybe it's the light and the sounds filtering through or just the fact that
everyone else is already up and moving. The environment has its own momentum,
and you kind of fall into it.

- Most people here are insanely fit and shredded. There is obviously no Cultfit
  here, but just leading an active lifestyle with physically intense farm work
  is more than sufficient i guess. Diet and food habits are also major factor,
  since there is very limited access to processed foods or sweet delicasies at
  the click of swiggy/zomato app.

No surprise that there are two centenarions in the village, who are still fairly
active for their age.

- Most evenings you could spot my mom in the portico of our house chatting with
  a group of 50 something women from the village. No agenda, just unfiltered
  download of their respective day. Meals cooked, plan for dinner mixed with
  some gossip. Had me thinking, this little ecosystem of conversation that's
  probably been happening in some form for generations and latest mode being
  "day in the life of" style vlogs

We as humans inherently need a peek into other peoples life,and village offer it
more naturally. And the unlucky city dwellers resort to vlogs on Youtube
instead. No wonder, the views are exploding

- Its amazing to observe how people who moved out from here years ago for better
  jobs, lifestyle to cities and towns are inclined to move back here post
  retirement. They are investing in buying land, renovating ancestral homes,
  tethering themselves back to where they started.

- Groceries have their own narrative here. No convenience of quick commerce.
  Vegetable vendors, fish sellers all operate on a schedule not according to our
  convenience. But somehow it still works, people plan, adjust and sometimes
  borrow but they make it work with not much inconvenience.

- In Nagercoil, the closest town, one can spot BYDs and Athers. Kind of odd to
  see these modern, sleek and quiet EVs navigating the same road I used to
  travel in an old ambassador with my grand dad. But yeah capitalism and
  consumerism finds its way and elated to see people moving up the economic
  ladder
